# Roadmap progress and parallel-worker handoff

Assessment date: 26 October 2026. Reference JavaScript is
`dca0888b827c5bc28fa9189bc9e1d507f5c5670c`; this checkout started from Rust
main `c7a37eb90b1ea335051bfc3cb7712116b372cfb7`.

The user assigned authenticated parent-UTXO snapshots and real script
verification to a separate worker. This pass implements independent supporting
modules and reviews transaction-index scheduling and parsing. It does not merge
that worker's branches, publish a branch, or authorize economic transitions.

## Tracking the 49 source modules

[PARITY_ROADMAP.csv](PARITY_ROADMAP.csv) contains all 49 JavaScript source
modules, excluding the experimental README. It records the four newly assessed
modules below and explicitly leaves the other 45 at their prior audit status.
It supplements the historical [full-tree inventory](JS_RUST_PORT_AUDIT.md),
whose earlier mappings and assessment commit are preserved.

[SUPPORTING_FUNCTION_PARITY.csv](SUPPORTING_FUNCTION_PARITY.csv) records 25
source functions with their tested domains, Rust tests and remaining criteria.
None of these rows or modules is marked as a complete production port.

| Module | Implemented and verified scope | Remaining completion criteria |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base94.js` | Eight helper methods, bounded string inputs, real-source golden vectors and preserved delimiter/fraction quirks | General JS coercions and malformed UTF-16; accepted historical wire transactions and admission integration |
| `base256.js` | Six helper methods, exact custom Unicode alphabet, bounded arbitrary-size arithmetic and source hex quirks | General JS coercions and malformed UTF-16; accepted historical transactions and wire integration |
| `tradeHistoryManager.js` | Seven query predicates, typed token/contract records, stable identities, atomic batches, canonical CRC checkpoint codec and rollback | Historical DB migration/order, positional/PnL/LIFO APIs, durable production persistence and chain-anchored replay |
| `volumeIndex.js` | Exact bounded VWAP, half-up prices, constant-share fee rounding, typed inclusive totals, source reverse-pair/classification characterization and rollback | Legacy DB normalization, valuation and historical prices, logarithmic attenuation, production persistence and reward issuance |

The combined [offline spot reporting adapter](OFFLINE_SPOT_REPORTING.md)
inserts existing spot fills into both indexes atomically, rejects network
mixing and duplicate observations, and rolls both back together. Addresses and
LTC valuation are explicit caller metadata. It retains exact traded amounts
and labels the volume price's eight-decimal rounding.

## Transaction throughput review

- [Parser review](TX_PARSER_REVIEW.md): found and fixed an inherited witness
  presence bug. A nonempty witness stack containing an empty item must be
  accepted for syntax inspection. Independent Python serialization/hashlib
  vectors exercise both standalone and fused/prepared paths, including 253
  inputs/outputs and nonminimal CompactSize encodings.
- [Scheduler review](TXINDEX_SCHEDULER_REVIEW.md): examines the newer pooled
  candidate `d4ba7592de3a93ee59ded6ebb2cd0cec91174368` in an isolated checkout.
  Reusable fault injection checks error ordering, panic shutdown, duplicates,
  and multiple windows. It also records the witness-only preindex binding
  boundary and the same-claim error/panic difference found in final review.
- [Benchmark review](THROUGHPUT_BENCHMARK_REVIEW.md): identifies unequal timer
  boundaries, missing full-pipeline scheduler comparisons, fixed measurement
  order, limited sampling and uniform synthetic inputs. The current-main
  executable now rotates eight phases, warms each one, prints raw timing
  samples, and reports full one-team ingestion, structural parsing and
  dependency planning separately. Pooled candidate measurements remain scoped
  to their reviewed revision. No default scheduler is changed.

Synthetic timings measure local parsing/hashing/indexing work. They exclude
real RPC, authenticated parent UTXOs, script verification, canonical chain
selection and serial TradeLayer economic application. The candidate pool's
temporary 512-observation bound is not a measurement of total resident memory.

## Next independent work

Continue the P1 economic modules against the pinned source: IOU bucket/claim
accounting, vault lifecycle and options execution. These require explicit
decimal precision and replay criteria before integration with the sole ledger.
Keep the separate worker's UTXO/script work and the Stage 25P/Q/R admission and
signed-channel gates visible as outstanding dependencies. Subsequent source
functions should receive individual test and historical-vector criteria before
their module status can advance.

## Local validation for this pass

Pinned Rust 1.90.0 on Windows/MSVC passed formatting (including separately
included implementation files), Clippy with warnings denied, all 546 Rust
tests across 74 test executables, doc tests, and the frozen release build of
all targets. The supply-chain verifier and its 11 adversarial tests passed.
Independent checks passed 1,221 Base94/Base256 golden rows, 24 source-executed
history queries plus the additional typed-query vector, 15 source-executed
volume/fee vectors, and 104 independently constructed parser vectors.

The isolated pooled candidate passed its 22 selected Rust integration tests.
The scheduler fault harness passed eight characterization tests against the
original source and eight against the explicitly proposed temporary patch.
The original mode includes the known same-claim panic-precedence divergence;
its passing result must not be read as evidence of complete error parity.
The corrected benchmark passed small, eight-repeat and 50-repeat smoke runs
with ordered equivalence and the requested timing sample counts. These are
local results; GitHub CI and separate Lean/Kani verifiers were not run here.
